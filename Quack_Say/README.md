# Quack Say

Quack is hibernating and is sleep-talking. Can you exploit his slumber to extract a couple of flags?

## Challenge Description

There are two parts to this challenge. As you must have observed, you are already given the flags. In `jail1.py`, you must enter an expression that would make Quack return the contents of `flag1.txt` to the output screen. `jail2.py` is similar except a few words are blocked. You need to enter an expression that would still make Quack return the contents of `flag2.txt` to the output screen.<br>
Your writeup to this challenge **must begin** with the expressions you input to retrieve the flag in `jail1.py` and `jail2.py` respectively.

## Scoring Mechanism
1. `jail1` gives you 10% of the total score of this challenge.
2. `jail2` gives you 90% of the total score of this challenge.
