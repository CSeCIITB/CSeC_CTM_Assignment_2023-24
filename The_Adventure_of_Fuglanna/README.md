# The Adventure of Fuglanna

Fieser püppchen is plotting to hide the flag away from tylluan in a desperate attempt to stop him from becoming CSeC core team member... To that end püppchen has decided to double encrypt the flag. However, Iolair, resourceful as always, was able to intercept the traffic between püppchen's computer and the hardware on which this encryption was occuring when püppchen tried to encrypt it for a second time. püppchen, realizing fuglanna were closing in, decided to erase the keys and the flag that was encrypted... Alas, they could only get back the remaining code and the trace Iolair captured. Tylluan suspected that they could retreive the flag in cleartext. Can you help the fuglanna?
