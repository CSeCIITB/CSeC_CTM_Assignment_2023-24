# CSeC_CTM_Assignment_2023-24

Ahoy, CTM applicants!

Welcome to the assignments leg of the CSeC CTM selection voyage.

In this repository, you'll find four challenge scrolls, each a test of y'er wits and will! And we, lads and lasses, ask for a write-up for each one of these challenges as ye' solve 'em, detailing the approach and path followed by ye in order to provide y'er captains as much insight into y'er train of thought.

Fair winds and following seas, sailors!
