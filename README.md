# CSeC Core Team Member Assignment 2023-24

Ahoy, CTM applicants!

Welcome to the assignments leg of the CSeC CTM selection voyage.

In this repository, ye'll find four challenge scrolls with a hidden flag, each a test of y'er wits and will! Y'er task is to find the flag(s) in each of these. And we, lads and lasses, ask for a write-up for each one of these challenges as ye solve 'em, detailing the approach taken and path followed by ye. 

The aim of a write-up is to provide y'er captains as much insight into y'er train of thought as possible. Pay heed: **except** for *Something Whaley*, on successfully solving a challenge y'er write-up needs to explain the approach that worked; if it did not, share with us every method ye tried. In the case of *Something Whaley*, we wish to know **every approach** ye tried - ne'er mind if they were successful or not. Try to provide as much insight into y'er thought process as possible.

Fair winds and following seas, sailors!

**Flag Format:** ```CSeC{...}```
